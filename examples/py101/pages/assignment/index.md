**Assignment 1: Python Basics**
=============================

**Objective**
------------

In this assignment, you will practice the basic syntax and data types of Python. You will write a Python program that demonstrates your understanding of variables, data types, and basic operators.

**Instructions**
---------------

1. Create a new Python file named `assignment1.py`.
2. Write a program that does the following:
	* Asks the user for their name and age.
	* Stores the user's name and age in variables.
	* Prints out a greeting message that includes the user's name and age.
	* Calculates and prints out the user's age in days.
3. Use the following data types:

	+ Integer (for the user's age)
4. Use the following operators:
	+ Assignment operator (=)
	+ Addition operator (+)
	+ Multiplication operator (\*)
5. Use the `input()` function to get user input.
6. Use the `print()` function to print output.

Hello, John! You are 25 years old.
You are 9125 days old.
```
